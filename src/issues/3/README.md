## 🤙 Functional → Function Component

Earlier this year Kyle Simpson ([getify](https://github.com/getify)) started to [raise concerns](https://mobile.twitter.com/getify/status/993127777057550336) about the terminology used for functional components. To avoid further confusion, we’ll refer to them as function components from now on.

## 📚 React Cache

We’re soon able to release the `simple-cache-provider` API as `react-cache`. Thanks to Marzio Superina ([msuperina](https://github.com/msuperina)) for handing over the npm package. This API will be helpful when working with [React Suspense](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html).
