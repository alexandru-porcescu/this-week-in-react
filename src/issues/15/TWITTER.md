📌 While the core team is getting hooks ready for a stable release, this work in progress pull request gives an early glimpse of the new DevTools integration.

➡️ The useImperativeMethods hook to customize the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using ref is now called useImperativeHandle.

👀 Context values that hold a primitive data type are now properly formatted in DevTools.

https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/pull/1256

🛠 The current owner and dispatcher are now properly separated. These two private APIs give deep access to React internals and a few external libraries depend on them. If your library does, check out the pull request for a migration strategy.

🌀 If you’ve played around with hooks before using the alpha release, make sure to upgrade to 16.8.0-alpha.0 and benefit from all bug fixes that were published with 16.7.0.
