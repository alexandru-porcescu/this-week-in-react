With [React Conf 2018](https://conf.reactjs.org/) right around the corner, we’re eagerly awaiting to hear more about the future of React. Here’s what we already know from looking at the GitHub repository this week:

---

## 🎉 Enable Suspense

Suspense is no longer behind a feature flag and will likely be part of the next release. Additional changes also include updated API names.

https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13799

---

## ➡️ React.pure() Automatically Forwards Ref

`React.pure()`, a new HOC to enable PureComponent behavior on function components that was recently merged, now comes with `forwardRef` support built-in.

https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13822

## 📱 Don’t Add onclick Listener to React Root

Thanks to an excellent bug report by Alexey Mikitevich ([amikitevich](https://github.com/amikitevich)) we were made aware of a recent regression in React DOM. If you’re into iOS Safari touch oddities, the bugfix PR is an interesting read.

## ⏱ Eagerly Schedule rAF at Beginning of Frame

The core team is working on perfecting the scheduler - one of the building blocks of React’s upcoming concurrent mode. It’s fascinating to see how the Scheduler improves over time.

## 🚫 Error Boundaries

In a recent Twitter discussion, the Core team shed some light on why it might be useful to rely on error boundaries even for the error handling of your non-React APIs.
