📱 Thanks to an excellent bug report by @_alex_mickey we were made aware of a recent regression in React DOM. If you’re into iOS Safari touch oddities, the bugfix PR is an interesting read.

⏱ The core team is working on perfecting the scheduler - one of the building blocks of React’s upcoming concurrent mode. Eager scheduling a rAF at beginning of frame is another useful improvement.

🚫 In a recent Twitter discussion, the Core team shed some light on why it might be useful to rely on error boundaries even for the error handling of your non-React APIs.
