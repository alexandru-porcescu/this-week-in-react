It‚Äôs time for your weekly list of ~~[emojis](https://mobile.twitter.com/PhilippSpiess/status/1060907216360914945)~~ uhm, I mean React insights. This weeks brings many interesting things, so let‚Äôs not waste time and dive right in:

## üêû Debug Tools Package for Introspection of Hooks

To make it easier to debug React Hooks, the team added a new experimental package for debugging React renderers.

## ü§û Avoid Double Commit by Re-rendering Immediately

To fix issues when using Suspense in non-concurrent mode, we now render the suspended and the fallback children within a single commit. Andrew also posted a great [summary of the PR](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14083#issuecomment-436045474).

## üóÑ Suspense Fuzz Tester

A new fuzz tester was added to improve the reliability of suspense. It works by generating random trees of React elements, with some elements that suspend and some that don‚Äôt.

## ‚è≥ Add a Low Priority to the Scheduler

Nathan Schloss ([n8schloss](https://github.com/n8schloss)) made a PR to add another priority level to the experimental Scheduler package. This new priority will still resolve but only after everything else. This is useful for logging or sending data back to the server.

## ü¶Ñ Unify Hooks‚Äô Second Argument Comparison

Thanks to Mateusz Burzy≈Ñski ([Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)) we now also have development warnings in the server renderer implementation for the second argument comparison implementation of hooks.

https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14036

---

## ‚ú® Warn for Bad `useEffect` Return Value

The cleanup function for the `useEffect` hook must always be returned synchronously, something that‚Äôs not possible to do when an async function is used. We now warn in such cases.

## üåÅ Fix Crash During Server Render in React 16.6

React can be loaded into many JavaScript runtimes. Thanks to Tiago Nunes ([tnunes](https://github.com/tnunes)), it can now again be loaded into environments without `setTimeout` (e.g. ClearScript for .NET).

https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14103

## üõ† Support `React.memo` and Timed-out Suspense Trees in Dev Tools

The official React Developer Tools browser extension was updated to support some of the newly released React features.
