🏗 I’m thrilled to present you the latest This Week In React ⚛️.

🚸 Two new RFCs: Fragment Refs and Custom Host Node
💬 Discussion: Ways to Bail out Inside Hooks
➡️ ... and more!

💌 Subscribe at this-week-in-react.org and read more in the thread below. 👇

🚸 RFC: Fragment refs are presented as an alternative to findDOMNode(). They would allow you to receive an array of DOM nodes rendered by children.

https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/97

---

🗂 RFC: Custom Host Nodes are an alternative to the useMutationEffect() API that was originally part of the hooks RFC but got removed later on.

https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/96

💬 Some use cases require function components with hooks to bail out early. The discussion gives insights into when this is needed. Make sure to check out @sebmarkbage’s latest response on this topic.
