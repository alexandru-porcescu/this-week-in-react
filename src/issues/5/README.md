It's time for another This Week in React ‚öõÔ∏è. Next week, the official React Conf 2018 is happening and we will learn more about the future of React - all of which will of course be covered in this newsletter.

## üî• RFC: React.pure()

The Core team filed an RFC for `React.pure` - an API that lets you bail out of updates from a function component, similar to `React.PureComponent` for classes.

https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/63

## üí• RFC: React.lazy()

To make it easier to code split individual components in React, the new `React.lazy()` API adds first-class support by embracing dynamic imports.

https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/64

---

## üöÄ RFC: Static contextType

The address some of the problems with render props for the new Context API, the Core team is working on `static contextType` as a new consuming mechanism. You can also look at the [preliminary documentation PR](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/1265).

## ‚ö°Ô∏è RFC: shouldComponentRemount

Alex Krolick ([alexkrolick](https://github.com/alexkrolick)) published an RFC for `shouldComponentRemount`, a new lifecycle method to control when React mounts and unmounts a component.

https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/62

## ‚è± Rename Priority Levels

The Core team also made small changes to some of the API names for the scheduler - one of the building blocks of React‚Äôs upcoming concurrent mode. The API is not final and we can expect an RFC soon.

https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13842

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Deprecate findDOMNode in StrictMode

In an attempt to make React applications easier to maintain, the Core team considers deprecating `findDOMNode`. The current API is breaking abstraction levels which leads to refactoring hazard.

## ‚è™ Revert: React.pure() Automatically Forwards Ref

Last week we were covering a PR that added `forwardRef` behavior to `React.pure()` by default. The PR was since reverted while the Core team is working on the future of ref forwarding.
