Another week is over and we‚Äôre back with hot news about React. Let‚Äôs dive right in with the biggest announcement during the React Conf keynote:

## üî•üî•Ô∏è RFC: React Hooks üî•üî•

The React team announced Hooks - A new and backwards-compatible Component API. In addition to the RFC, the team also launched [a complete set of documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). You can play around with React Hooks today by using the v16.7.0-alpha release on npm.

## üéâ React v16.6.0: lazy, memo and contextType

This week also marks the release of the stable v16.6 release. This not only adds the [lazy](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/1284), [memo](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/1282), [contextType](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/1283), and [getDerivedStateFromError](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/1223) APIs that we covered in previous issues, but is also the first public build where Suspense is no longer behind a feature flag and [not marked unstable](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13922).
