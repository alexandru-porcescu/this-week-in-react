🔥🔥 The React team announced React Hooks - A new and backwards-compatible Component API. In addition to the RFC, the team also launched a complete set of docs. You can play around with Hooks today by using the v16.7 alpha release.

🎉 This week also marks the release of the stable v16.6 release. This not only adds the lazy, memo, contextType, and getDerivedStateFromError APIs, but is also the first build where Suspense is no longer behind a feature flag.

⏱ Concurrent APIs (ReactDOM.createRoot and <ConcurrentMode/>) will now no longer be unstable in the upcoming v16.7.0 release.

➡️ After discussions in last week’s React.pure() RFC, the team decided to change the name of that API to React.memo().

📚 The React Cache API is still unstable and will undergo more changes. The cache is now read from context and cache invalidation was removed entirely. You can try it out in the v2.0.0-alpha.0 release.
